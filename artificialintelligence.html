  <div>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, learning, reasoning, and understanding natural language. AI technologies, such as machine learning, robotics, and neural networks, are transforming industries by enabling automation, improving decision-making, and enhancing user experiences. From self-driving cars to virtual assistants and medical diagnostics, AI continues to revolutionize the way we interact with technology, making processes more efficient and intelligent.</p>

	<p>One of the most promising areas is general AI, where machines will not just follow predefined patterns but will have the ability to think, learn, and adapt like humans. AI-driven automation will revolutionize industries by improving efficiency, reducing human errors, and increasing productivity in sectors such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and logistics.The integration of AI with robotics will lead to advancements in autonomous systems, from self-driving cars to robotic assistants that can perform everyday tasks. Natural Language Processing (NLP) will enhance human-computer interactions, making AI-powered virtual assistants more intuitive and lifelike.</p>
